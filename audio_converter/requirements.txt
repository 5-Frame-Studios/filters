# Audio Converter Filter Requirements
# 
# This filter uses pydub for audio processing, which provides audio conversion
# capabilities without requiring external ffmpeg installation.

# Python Dependencies:
pydub>=0.25.1

# Optional: For better audio processing performance
# numpy>=1.21.0

# System Requirements:
# - No external ffmpeg installation required
# - pydub handles audio conversion internally

# Installation:
# pip install pydub

# Note: pydub may use ffmpeg internally on some systems, but it's handled
# automatically and doesn't require manual installation in most cases.
